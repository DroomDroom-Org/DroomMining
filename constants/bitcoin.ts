      "Click 'Calculate Profit' to see real-time earnings, ROI, and break-even time.",

    question: "How does Bitcoin mining work?",
    answer: [
      "Miners compete to solve complex math puzzles (hashes) to validate transactions.",
      "The first to solve the puzzle adds a new block and earns the block reward.",
      "Current reward: 3.125 BTC per block (post-2024 halving).",

      "CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs are no longer profitable for Bitcoin mining.",
      "Top models: Bitmain Antminer S21, MicroBT Whatsminer M60S, etc.",

  {
    question: "How do I set up a Bitcoin mining rig?",
    answer: [
      "1. Buy ASIC miner(s) from reputable vendors.",
      "2. Ensure 220V+ power with sufficient amperage (e.g., 200A service = ~33kW usable).",
      "3. Connect to stable internet and cooling system.",

    answer: [
      "Solo mining is statistically impossible due to 600+ EH/s network hashrate.",
      "Pools combine hashrate from thousands of miners to find blocks faster.",
      "Rewards are split proportionally (PPS, FPPS, PPLNS payout models).",

      "At 1 PH/s: ~2,500 days (~6.8 years).",
      "At 10 PH/s (data center): ~250 days.",

    question: "How much electricity do I need to mine Bitcoin?",
    answer: [
      "Calculate: Hashrate × Efficiency (J/TH) = Watts.",
